# Beejan Technologies End-to-End Pipeline Design for Complaints Resolution.

## Problem Statement
Beejan Technologies, a telecom company, receives complaints from multiple channels including social media, call center log files, SMS, and website forms. Currently, the data is stored in silos managed by different teams, leading to inconsistent reports and decrease in productivity.

## Goal of Solution
- Create a unified view of data from all source.
- Standardize, clean, and enrich the data so it provides clear, actionable insights.


## Design Scope

### Data Sources 
- Social media - Unstructured data (tweets, videos, images, posts etc)
- Call center logs - Semi structured data (JSON format)
- SMS - text file
- Website forms - Structured data (rows and column)
  Combination of Batch and Streaming Frequency.

### Ingestion Strategy
- Batch Ingestion - Call Center logs and SMS file uploads at scheduled intervals (hourly / daily).
- Stream Ingestion - Social media posts through APIs and Website form submissions as events(ingested the moment a customer submits).

### Processing & Transformation
All ingested data lands in a raw zone (source of truth). From here, processing, cleaning, and enrichment take place:
- Remove duplicates
- Standardize formats(field names, timestamps, schema validation)
- Handle missing or invalid values
- Enrichment - add complaint type columnn, derived columns for deeper insights.

## Classification
Complaints are grouped into buckets for clarity:
- Network (Latency)
- Incorrect Billing
- Bad Customer Service

## Storage Options
- Data Lake: Raw landing zone, storing everything ingested as source as truth.
- Data Warehouse: Structured, cleaned, and modeled data for fast analysis and reporting.
  File formats: Parquert for efficiency and low cost, JSON where flexibility is needed.


## Serving Layer
Processed data in the warehouse will be available to query using SQL

### Use Cases
- Operations teams: Monitor spikes in compliants for faster engagements, trigger real-time alerts.
- Business leads: Dahsboards summarizing complaint trends
- Leadership: Periodic executive summaries.

## Orchestration & Monitoring
- Scheduling: Batch Ingestion Pipelines run hourly or daily: Streaming Pipelines run continously.
- Failure Handling: Logs to trace errors, notifications for failed pipelines of data quality checks (e.g sudden drop in volume, missing fields).

## Dataops Consideration
To ensure Pipeline runs efficiently, production ready and with minimal downtime, the following setup would be added: 
- CI /CD - Continous integration and Continous deployments
- Versioning Control - so changes in schema or code don't break.
- Security controls
     - Principle of least access to protect pipeline integrity
     - Role-based access on data warehouse (teams only see what they should)   
- Monitoring & alerting
- Scalability - Cloud Infra setup to handle sspikes in data.
- Security & Compliance - Encryption, masking sensitive informations (e.g phone numbers etc)
